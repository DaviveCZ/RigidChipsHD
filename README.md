An attempt at improving graphics for Rigidchips to make it look similar to Panekit while making Quality of Life fixes.

With help from [HumanGamer](https://github.com/HumanGamer)

Also check out the [RigidChips Modeler](https://github.com/HumanGamer/rcm) which we translated to English and fixed a few bugs!

Camera is controlable with numpad and mouse.
